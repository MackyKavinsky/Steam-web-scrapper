Recommended,Posted: 9 January,Thank you internet historian| very cool!
Recommended,Posted: 25 December| 2019,A game with real heart from a team who never ever gave up. What's not to like?
Recommended,Posted: 2 April,Hello Games taught us two lessons. -How not to launch a game-How to revive and keep supporting a game.Greatest comeback 8/10
Recommended,Posted: 3 May,This game has risen from the Ashes. All the respect for the devs for not giving up. Internet Historian really made me feel for the devs.
Recommended,Posted: 27 May,I've never written a review before for anything but that is changing right now. I discovered No Man's Sky about a month ago. I originally bought it to play in VR but quickly discovered that it was also enjoyable on the PC once I got the hang of the key mappings.I've never played console games but it's safe to say I'm hooked with just over 150 hours in the last 3 weeks. I look forward to the daily Nexus missions and only have one more before I have enough quicksilver to get an important item| I got my freighter a couple of days ago and I LOVE fighting pirates. Who would have thought a 58 year old grandmother would become a No Man's Sky avid player!  :-)
Recommended,Posted: 2 January,Ok. Is someone actually still reading these reviews? Well if you get to this one| among the thousands of reviews for NMS| then you really are committed. As I'm sure you know by now| this game was an utter fail when it was released. The description of the game sounded so amazing| like everything you could ever want from a space-themed| sandbox builder. It was lame and repetitive with a low variety of content. The launch was done all wrong and| the term 'false advertising' was kicked around a lot. Well| luckily the developers didn't stop. It is now a complete game. There are SO many aspects to this game from flight (space or on planet)| farming (mining)| exploration| discovery| fighting off attacks from animals and drones (sentinels)| to my favorite| amazing base-building with SO FREAKING MANY build options. They keep adding new ones too. Hello Games also recently released VR support| and it's really well done. There's something about being able to walk around in the base that you built| in real scale with VR. Hundreds of hours have gone into some of the most amazing bases I've built| and am planning for hundreds more.
Recommended,Posted: 10 May| 2019,Do I recommend this game?    YESThe game launch was a disaster. Yet where many games would tuck tail| grab as much income as possible and bail| Hello (the dev) stuck with it. They turned this game into everything it should be. Now we are getting true multiplayer and VR! NOW is the time to pull the trigger on this game.To the devs: Thanks for doing the right thing.
Recommended,Posted: 7 April,As everyone knows| No Man's Sky is a modern cautionary tale about pre-release game development. What not everyone knows| but people are slowly beginning to learn| is that it's also an exemplar of ongoing game development. Like many| I bought NMS at launch| and was underwhelmed by it. I wasn't outraged| as so many were| but it seemed like a great example of over-promising and under-delivering. I played enough to get bored with the mechanics| marveled a bit at the color and scope of the worlds while being frustrated with the mechanics| and blundered around without a very well-defined tutorial path. Then I went on to other things instead.Four years later| all of the good things about NMS have been retained and improved| all of the bad things have been resolved| and features I never even hoped for have been added. The dev team has been responsive| engaged and imaginative. It would have been understandable for Hello Games to fold up| after an Icarus story so painfully acted out| but instead they doubled down on their commitments and have turned No Man's Sky into a genuinely wonderful gaming experience.I honestly cannot say enough positive things about it. It is a shining example of how game development can work when driven by a team that wants to do the absolute best they can for their audience| delivering content-filled updates regularly without asking a penny more than the original cost of the game. I have looked for ways to give them more of my money| and have settled for evangelizing about it to all of my friends. Especially now - if you have free time| get NMS.
Recommended,Posted: 26 November| 2019,It was a disaster at launch with so many broken promises but the developers didn't abandon the game as so many large publishers did with their IP when it flopped| instead they grew a spine and started working on it| adding features which were promised before and made a decent game out of it.
Recommended,Posted: June 22,Thank you for not giving up.
Recommended,Posted: August 8| 2018,For many years| (I am 64)| I have played space exploration| colonization and strategy games| hoping to feed my dreams of actually living in and exploring space. I don't have much of a taste for endless combat| I just wanted to explore star systems| planets and asteroid fields and imagine what it would really be like to live my dreams.No Man's Sky is the closest thing to living in and exploring space that I have found so far. It certainly has room for improvement| but there are so many features and things to do that it has kept me busy so far. Love it.
Not Recommended,Posted: August 25| 2016,(Updated at bottom)It doesn't actually feel like a real universe| there are no planetary physics and gravity is the same on all planets. There are no actual solar systems. The planets don't rotate around a sun but are stationary| sitting together in a blob. The moons don't even go around the planets.All of the various wonders of the universe (neutron stars| supernovas| pulsars| etc) are entirely absent. There are no stars| they're just part of the skybox but you can't fly to them.The 18 quintillion planets that was so heavily marketed isn't impressive when you realize what that actually means: if you took 11 things and come up with 50 variations for each| that is close to 18 quintillion combinations. Most planets are entirely the same but with different bumps and colors| they have the same objects on them and largely the same resources. Once you've seen the first dozen planets| you've seen them all.You don't have a sense of scope/scale to your journey. In the galactic map you can see other stars but there's no sense of where you are in relation to the center of the universe. Likewise you don't have a way to track where you were. No mapping or history| waypoints or other ways of tracking your progress. The only way to travel between systems is to open up the map and click warp| which initiates a loading screen animation and loads up the new planets. There is no deep space. You feel like you're in an instance with 3 or 4 planets that are mostly the same| then you load up a new skybox with a new set of similar planets. It's nothing like say Space Engine| where you actually do get a true sense that you're in a real universe.You can't manually land your ship| you simply press a button for it to autoland. Tons of other maneuvers (like entering a space station) are entirely autopilot. The asteroids which are everywhere have insane pop-in issues| they only show up like 50 meters in front of you.The freight ships don't move| they just sit there passively forever. They add zero gameplay depth.The space stations are all basically the same.The planets are littered with outposts| all identical and with a single NPC alien standing still and staring into the wall.The NPCs are entirely shallow| there is literally no point to even talking to them since they never say anything interesting and simply give you something random you likely don't need. Even the automated quest giving NPCs in Bethesda games that hand out those Radiant AI quests would be a massive improvement.All of the monoliths are the same| it's nothing but a chore to chase them down. The words you learn don't add any depth to your interactions with the aliens| since they never have anything interesting to say anyway.The animals are built on 14 different skeleton designs| with a bunch of random animal parts scrapped on top of each section to maximize the number of permutations and there is no attempt to make the animal make any sense in it's environment or have anything unique in it's behavior. The animals have no evolutionary history and their behavior is incredibly shallow.There are no tall trees like were shown in E3| they're all saplings. There are no large forests| no large creatures. There are no large valleys| huge mountain peaks| no giant volcanos| all terrain is uniformly similar across planets.The grinding which makes up most of the game is not only boring| but frustrating due to the completely messed up inventory management.The interface is atrocious. It's amazing that it can be messed up this bad| the fact that we need a mod just to remove the requirement that you must hold each click for a second speaks volumes. You need to load up a menu to do anything| and the menus are terribly designed and completely unintuitive.The game is a technical mess. It looks like ♥ yet runs with all sorts of framerate issues.It fails as a survival game since nothing in the game leaves you threatened. Each planet is seeded with abundant resources| and the few things that do attack you are easily defeated. Compare to minecraft where there's a very definite risk / reward system to exploring a deep cave system. Nothing really threatens you in a meaningful way.The different minerals and resources don't really matter. Since most of the upgrades to explore the universe are yours within the first hour / two hours all the rest are kind of nice add ons.There's no challenge to exploring. There's very little combat and what combat there is very boring.All planets are accessible right from the start of the game. I was excited about the idea of acid planets| radioactive planets| cold planets ... I was thinking that to explore a radioactive planet you'd need to craft some special gear. There was a pretty obvious gameplay loop where the dangerous planets had better minerals/ruins/whatever but were very hard to explore. Instead every planet is basically just a copy of the others.The constant need to recharge things| which don't really serve a purpose. It makes the game very grindy without any positive feedback. Instead of feeling free to explore the world around me I feel annoyed that if I see something cool it means 30 seconds of tedium while I mine the abundant plutonium. I end up not landing and exploring because of how annoying it is that to take off again I must enter a menu and recharge my ship.None of the aliens interact with each other or have any sort of AI other than 'walk around a bit'. There's nothing to sit and watch. An occasional ship will fly overhead but they don't do anything. You never really see a battle take place or the ships acting in any sort of interesting manner.Update 2019: redacted previous points above that I thought were updated| most points are still disappointingly true. There have been add-ons like the buggies for getting around faster| base building| multiplayer (which was a promised feature from the beginning but whatever) and a few updates to the resource/crafting tree as well as a story. But the reality is that it's just a new coat of paint on a big turd. I tried to continue from my old save file and all of my blueprints| technologies| some resources| etc. were all gone and replaced with a module called “obsolete technology.” Apparently I saved in a completely dead system cause none of the planets had anything other than sentinels and animals. No beacons| crashed ships| and incredibly scarce resources. Now I didn't have any warp cells nor the ability to craft any to escape this dead system| I couldn't even craft the visor to locate the anomaly the game constantly was telling me to go to. I asked reddit and others for help but was told that now there’s just dead systems from the update and I should just start anew. I started up a new file and threw my ship| now useless multitool| and maxed out exosuit away. So much grinding for nothing. Turns out the only thing that makes this game challenging is the lack of upgrades| blueprints| technologies because without them grinding for materials to craft upgrades| blueprints| and technologies is super slow. They pretty much just added intermediary steps to the crafting tree (now you must refine the carbon by crafting a refiner and then finding fuel for the refiner). The added story is about as deep and interesting as mining materials. The story progresses by errand running on a galactic scale to the point that the "characters” which send you on the errands make less and less sense. Somehow the ship controls are worse and make shooting other ships very frustrating. The only challenging part of space dogfights is the ship controls.There’s still bugs too| a lot. You can fall through the floor of a planet or have your ship spawn under the floor| the game will crash randomly| put down a refiner and then not be able to pick it back up again or its contents.But every 100 or so planets you visit will be pretty.With such lack of depth and poor execution Hello Games is criminal to charge more than $10.
Recommended,Posted: December 21| 2019,Launch controversy aside| what this game should have been called for the longest time is 'Early Access'. Around the time of the Beyond update is when I'd say would have been the true 'launch'. I didn't get this when it first came out| but even when I did it was a fragmented mess of a game. Now| finally| with the Beyond and Synthesis updates there's a solid game here that's almost (but not quite) like what Sean Murray promised way back at the beginning.Performance on PC has dramatically improved with the switch over to the Vulkan API| and it finally supports Ultrawide and various other PC-specific options. The game itself provides a significant amount of variety| offering a combination of Elite-lite and 'Minecraft in Space' mechanics. There's plenty to see and do| and the exploration aspect is enjoyable - if a little bland. The planetary biomes and overall game could still do with further diversity| but there's plenty here to get to your teeth into.Hello Games show no sign of slowing down their support for the game either| having just recently released a bizarre in-game music synthesizer of all things| and going by the evidence of their progress to date I can only see the game improving further as time moves on.
Recommended,Posted: March 1,I'm drunk| so i'll keep this quick.Internet Historian was right.Whatever was wrong with this game at the outset| is gone. With Hello Games' hard work| they've made a game everyone says was bad| into a game that is actually pretty ♥♥♥♥in' good. And given their track record after release| it'll only get better. I mean c'mon| they could've just taken the millions they made and ran off. Instead they busted their asses finishing this game and making it better than even THEY could have imagined. As far as i'm concerned| such a stalwart and excellent work ethic deserves to be rewarded.
Recommended,Posted: January 25,Check out the Internet Historians video for the best description of the fall and rise of this game| but personal opinions on it| I really enjoy it| is a bit grindy at times| combat is pretty solid| ship piloting is pretty smooth| the mission system is cool| and base building is awesome| the game does still has a few optimization issues| and bug fixes that will probably be worked out soon| but all in all the game is a 8/10 not a bad game anymore but also not without its own flaws. i recommend anyone to check it out if you can.
Recommended,Posted: April 19| 2019,This game had a disastrous launch. Sean Murray seemed like a lying over-promising cheat| at launch.They could've taken the money they made and run with it| millionaires all of them.Instead| they stuck around and made the game better and better| expansion after free expansion| improvement after improvement. No Man's Sky went from a good concept to a beautiful reality. This game deserves all the love it can get.
Recommended,Posted: March 24,I bought this game during the COVID-19 outbreak and I must say it is the ultimate time consumer. I did not get bored of this game for 20 hours straight . There is so much to do constantly. There is so much customization in literally everything.
Recommended,Posted: March 11,bought the game in summer 2018... played 45 min.  didn't get into it.fired it up again in jan 2020... haven't stopped playing it.phenomenal game.  recommend playing with a buddy if you can.  don't look at the internet for solutions - figure it out yourself| and you will be so rewarded.
Recommended,Posted: August 10| 2019,It started with a bunch of lies.  They paid for it with outrage and threats.  But instead of walking away with the profits they decided this is not how Hello Games will end.  Update after update No Man's Sky got better and better.  Development and a great deal of time costs money and yet they decided to update the game for free.  Thank you Hello Games.
Recommended,Posted: November 22| 2018,I remember in 2016 when I've pre-ordered this game because of hype train and my obsession of space exploration. But| this game broke my heart when released. It's broken and I've nominated this game as The Worst Game Award in 2016's steam awards. At the times I've really hate Hello Games that lie about this games.After update by update| at current state this game get better and better. Hello Games tried to fix their mess in 2016 and it works. In 2018| No Man's Sky is a very good game compared by launch state. With love| Hello Games keep updating this game to make a better No Man's Sky experience that they promise before the launch. And| in my humble opinion at current state with NEXT update this game need a second chance to be the best game in space exploration genre.Without shame| I've nominated this game as The "Labor of Love" Award in Steam Awards 2018.
Recommended,Posted: June 1,No Man's Sky used to be overrated and is now underrated| this game is one of the most tragic stories of any videogame that ever existed. At the start| the game was laggy and bad and didn't have multiplayer so it got a lot of bad reviews. But| weirdly enough| developers continued making updates and now is one of the best games I ever played. An awesome game that has multiplayer| missions| pets| nice NPCs| spaceships and spaceship upgrades| exocraft| monsters etc. The universe in this game is infinite and it is constantly expanding making random planets that makes this game never get old. The coding behind this game makes it only a few gigabytes small with pretty small loading times. It still has bugs here and there but the way things are going I think they will patch all of it. ☄️ 5 / 5 Wisps
Recommended,Posted: July 25| 2018,Honestly not a bad game. at launch it was a little barren but was still kinda fun to just sail the solar systems| but with aaaall the stuff brought with the updates| now including multiplayer| its easily worth the original pricetag. and if you're mad that you basically got a early access title at supposed "launch"| remember that 99% of any other game devs would've chocked it up as a loss and worked on No Man's Sky 2| but these guys actually worked tirelessly for years under extreme scrutiny and prejudice to bring us a game worth our quid| *and they're still updating*. If that doesn't earn back a little respect I truly do not know what would.
Recommended,Posted: May 8,No Man's Sky has come a long way since its initial release. There's a lot to enjoy now| but there are some things I feel I need to mention to gamers like me who are reconsidering this title in 2020.First| the good news. There is a fair amount of gameplay variety these days: running missions| space combat| building a base| and upgrading your equipment. And yes| you can now do all these things with your friends -- the game supports co-op sessions with up to 4 people.However| the game is still| at its core| a single-player experience focused on exploring new planets and scanning alien life forms. And unfortunately| most of the other features feel like an afterthought by comparison. Some examples:- Your progress is saved locally. If the game crashes (and it will)| you will lose your progress. This is very confusing in a game that portrays itself as a persistent open world adventure.- Your base is saved locally| and uploaded to the server periodically. If the game crashes| there is potential for major conflicts| such as two copies of your base being stacked on top of one another| which leads to permission issues and the inability to remove the old copy. Extremely frustrating. The problems compound when you try to build a base with a friend. In our squad| this was easily the most disappointing part of the game.- Because of the local saving| it is very easy to edit your save file to load unlimited supplies and equipment. The server does NOT verify your inventory.- There is no resource scarcity. In a game about finding and collecting resources| this feels very odd. Once you get past a certain threshold of "units" (the in-game currency)| you can easily purchase huge quantities of items on the market| or buy a new ship to shoot NPCs with impunity. The challenge factor goes way down at that point| and consequently so does the fun.- For all the development effort that has gone into the game of late| there seems to have been a severe lack of QA. The game crashes A LOT. Bugs abound; some are hilarious| some are infuriating.That being said| this can still be a fun game to put 30-40 hours into with your friends. Save often. Upload your base any time you make even the smallest change. Warp throughout the galaxy| check out new planets| and marvel at the visually-impressive worlds and curious alien life forms you'll encounter.Base building is not as good as Rust. Space combat is not as good as Elite Dangerous. The market is not player-driven as it is in EVE. The gunplay is subpar by any measure.But No Man's Sky does all these things _pretty decently_| and the result is a fun romp around the galaxy.6/10
Recommended,Posted: July 29| 2019,This game has done a complete 180. It went from a game I hated so much| to something I enjoy playing. Get your friends online and go explore the galaxy and build amazing bases.
Not Recommended,Posted: October 4| 2016,''As wide as an ocean| but has the depth of a puddle.''                                                     Angry Joe - 2016
Not Recommended,Posted: November 22| 2016,I put my fair share of time in (nearly 36 hours at time of writing). I grinded out most everything. I have fully explored several planets| maxed out inventories and travelled accross countless star systems. I spent hours simply building up language database. Do you know what i have to show for it? Nothing. it was a waste of time.To be clear| this is a beautiful looking game| with lot's of hope and wonder| that leads to absolutely nothing. I spent hours building up resources and inventories and amassing fortunes. With nothing to do with it. All that time spent learning languages| and there was no point. Anything important story-wise| is in common language. I had much hope| waiting for something to happen. It didn't. You build random items and fuels| but that's it. You can only move from one place to another| and very little changes. Buildings are virtually identical and evenly distributed on EVERY planet. You can spot them and know exactly what they are| and what they will contain. They are unbelieveably generic. Every NPC is the same. I spent hours learning languages of a particular race. 20+ building oup relations of 1 of the 3 races| so much so i was able to decipher almost the entire language in every dialogue. Do you know what I discovered? That it didn't matter. As soon as I discovered the 2nd race| it didn't matter that I didn't know a single word. They were identical. Sure they looked different a little| but every interaction was identical. There is no point to any of the languages| they amount to nothing at all. By the time you get enough to start deciphering the exact words| what they have to say is entirely useless anyway. Did you like that outpost you were at? Too bad| you'll never find it again because navigation is terrible. But don't worry| it doesn't matter because there is another outpost that is identical| just jump in your ship and fly in any direction for less than a minute and you'll find the same damn place with a different name.This game was like the ending of the TV Show "Lost"| lots of buildup for a complete let down. Accumulate for no reason| talk for no reason| explore for no reason. I like a grind| but you don't even have anything to show for it. You'll never go back to wherever you were| and you'll never be able to share what you find with another human being. Cool| on this planet I'm going to name everything after memes. cool. What's the point? I'll never see that planet again when i leave for the next one. I gave this game far too much of a chance| and too much of my time. Go play minecraft| at least here you can build something. Play an MMO| at least there you can talk to someone. Go play a game with any form of campaign| at least you'll get a story. NMS is like all those games| without the things that make them great. No story| no meaningful building| no social. This feels entirely like an MMO that is empty. Accumulate wealth to buy nothing of worth| to quest with no one| and find nothing of note.
Recommended,Posted: January 5| 2019,No Man's Sky is an...interesting situation.First impressions are everything for a game| and No Man's Sky gave quite a first impression for sure. Pre-launch| No Man's Sky promised to be the game literally everybody dreams about. Touting quintillions of planets| each randomly generated and different from the last| with random creatures| plants| and geology. No Man's Sky was looking too good to be true| and that was absolutely the case at launch.Nearly every feature advertised in the trailers| interviews| and pre-launch material was missing. Instead| there was a boring husk of a game| with boring planets and same-y fauna.Then there was the first major patch - Foundation. Foundation added basebuilding similar to subnautica| a survival mode| farming| freighters| and a whole host of quality of life improvementsThen there was the second patch - Pathfinder. Pathfinder added vehicles| base sharing| permadeath mode| more starships| new shops| and even more content. The game was still early| but the groundwork was there.The Atlas Rises update added a story mode| new planet types| missions and so much more. It fixed major issues with the UI and QOL improvements. It was shaping up to somethingThen there was NEXT. NEXT is the update that truly changed NMS for the better. Multiplayer| unlimited base building| community reasearch| third person mode| character customization| and so much more.Then came two smaller| but still substantial updates| Abyss and Visions. Abyss focused on improving undersea wildlife| and made the underwater sections of the game look beautiful. Visions added variation to planets| trophies| carniverous plants| and improved the visual fidelity.No Man's Sky was a complete ♥♥♥♥ing failure at launch. But that's simply not the case any more. Hello Games has proven that it's possible to redeem something thought to be unredeemable. They made the biggest dissapointment of 2016 into a fully fleshed game| and it's only getting better with time.I don't think NMS is worth 60 dollars. Not yet. I paid 30| and I don't regret my purchase.No Man's Sky is| in my opinion| a good game. There is still much to wait for| but I say it is worth the purchase now.
Recommended,Posted: March 8| 2019,I have got to say this game was a complete and utter failure when it launched. So much hype for nothing. But| a ray of hope as the devs pulled themselves together and shot through the darkness of that shadow of doubt everyone cast on you. How did they do that? By adding MASSIVE updates and fixes to the game. Much more content and is still growing! Multiplayer before being something that could happen if you were lucky| is now a easy| more engaging and fun experience! I have to tip my hat to this dev team! You guys pulled yourselves out of the mud. I recommend for sure!
Recommended,Posted: September 9| 2017,So I pre-ordered this.At the time| when I first played it| I came to regret that as a mistake. I sank a couple hours in here and there| but I just couldn't get into it. The story felt dull| the landscapes were just... off| and it just wasn't what was advertised.I cast it aside| too late to refund.Base building came out| along with vehicles| creative mode| and a camera. I played around with them| and they were fun - but the survival still felt lackluster. Creative mode got boring fast| and the camera (probably one of my favourite game features at the time) was hardly worth going into the game to use just for screenshots.And now| after the Waking Titan ARG - we have Atlas Rises.To be honest - I'm impressed. Suddenly| I find myself wanting to play survival because it's fun. Hell| I find myself wanting to play the game itself because I enjoy it now| not because I'm bored and need to sink time into something. The story is interesting and I want to see more| dozens of tiny little things that weren't there suddenly are...It's a new experience.In all honesty| I would have much preferred to see the game in this state on release. That way I would have been spared a year of disappointment. Hello Games has done what few developers would have done after the disaster of the release| and has spent time and effort making this game into something they can be proud of. It's clear they believe in the potential of No Man's Sky| and I find that inspiring.I can finally| in good conscience| recommend this game.I think the price is still too steep - but I would recommend it on half price.
Recommended,Posted: January 13,internet historian and my own experience have made me realize i was wrong and we should have been more understanding though they are not without their blame they are genuinely trying to make things right
Recommended,Posted: September 29| 2019,Just lower the price and everyone will be happier.
Recommended,Posted: July 26| 2018,Different game from 2 years ago. Hello Games did not walk away. Good on them.
Recommended,Posted: December 13| 2019,This game got SO much better. The rating for the game will take a while to improve| but if Hello keeps it up| it will eventually go up. The game today is far different than the pre-order days| and they did a good job making up for the fact that they put out an unfinished game| that didn't deliver on the promises made. When it was released: 3/10 - 4/10As it stands today: 8/10
Recommended,Posted: July 22| 2018,So here's the thing...All things considered| No Man's Sky is a good game. I think it's a great game| but my tastes are veeerry specific.NMS filled a desire I've had for a VERY long time. I just wanted to simply fly and walk around planets in a game that wasn't as artistically dry as| say| Elite Dangerous| or as simplistic and railroaded as Spore.That's all it needed to impress me| but it has done so much more than that.I think there is enough here now after all the updates| especially the upcoming NEXT patch| for a typical sci-fi fan to get a good kick out of.In No Man's Sky| you'll be spending a lot of your time:1. Collecting materials to sell off| craft| or fuel up your equipment| among other things.2. Building a base and doing missions to unlock more building parts and items from your base NPCs.3. Flying around space. Protip: this is a good time to manage your inventory.4. Accepting faction missions and trading at space stations.5. Interacting with NPCs who may give you rewards for solving their problems or doing what they ask.6. Collecting words of alien languages to help you understand the NPCs problems better.7. Exploring| just in general. It's nice to just kick back and wander sometimes.8. Finding upgrades: better multitools| exosuit tech| ships| vehicles| and upgrades to install into each of them.9. Shooting at pirates| sentinels| and very ugly animals.10. Progressing through the "Atlas Rises" story missions.11. Trying (and in my case failing) to save up money for a bigass freighter| which you can also build a base in.12. Trying (and most assuredly failing) to 100% catalog the species of a planet for a big money bonus.13. Uploading and optionally renaming your discovered planets and lifeforms for cash.14. Raiding buildings on planets for useful junk or coordinates to other useful junk.14 1/2. Probably more I forgot about?That's the basic overview| but... I really want to address something important.This game was indeed overhyped| but at the same time| was also overcriticized at the beginning| understandably so given the information at the time.But the truth is| there's more nuance to what happened than "Sean tricked us into buying an unfinished game."Considering the hard work they've been putting into these free updates over the last couple of years| the idea that Sean was intentionally trying to scam people doesn't quite add up. And it would seem that my first guess as to what really happened was pretty much true.Sean Murray is a passionately ambitious dev| but isn't exactly a PR and marketing pro. And that worked against him| tragically.According to a recent interview| Sean Murray claims that he was not really prepared to properly and carefully consider his messaging during pre-release interviews and gameplay videos where certain features were detailed that didn't make it to the release build. It was obvious that he loved what he was making and naively wanted to share his complete vision with future players| but was not clear about what was going on in development at the time| and in what state these features were in.Some of those features were being worked on| but didn't quite make it to release due to budget and time crunch problems.Some of those features simply never made it even though they appeared in early trailers| like sand worms. Possibly due to bugs or gameplay issues| as that's why most cool features get cut before a release.One key example is multiplayer. Before release| HG had been working on the barebones floating orb multiplayer feature we now have currently. The nature of this "multiplayer" lines up with what Sean vaguely described in interviews.However| HG was simply not able to wrap up development of the multiplayer feature| and had to push it back.Now... none of this *really* excuses releasing a game that is missing promised (or implied) features.But what I can say is that it's clear to me that there was nothing malicious or greedy behind the situation HG put themselves in. They had a PR crisis. A particularly bad one| the reaction to which I think was unwarranted considering what we know now.This narrative that Hello Games was out to scam people is not only a silly notion considering their dedication to continuing work on the game| but it unnecessarily drives people away from an experience they may actually enjoy if they were to get past the development drama. It has become so pervasive that even people who have never even played or looked at footage of the game are now parroting hyperbolic nonsense that it had the worst launch of all time and that it was a giant scam. This is a frustrating case of bandwagoning.By continuously working on NMS| and adding large swaths of content with every expansion| HG has shown me| through their actions| not words| that they are not the bad-faith actors they are made out to be.I can certainly forgive the mishandling of the hype and launch considering what we'll be getting in just a couple days with NEXT.With that in mind| I am not angry with HG or Sean| nor was I even disappointed with the initial release. I played it. I liked it. It was repetitive| sure| but it was unique and aesthetically striking.I just wish they would've communicated more effectively initially. If I went through what they went through| I don't know if I would've had the strength to continue. Though maybe the backlash put a fire under HG's ♥♥♥ to prove the naysayers wrong.Who knows...The TL;DR is: If someone has convinced you that No Man's Sky is some kind of horrible| hugely disappointing game| that may be their real opinion| but they are almost certainly exaggerating for the thrill of exacting righteous fury on a perceived sleight.I encourage you to look more objectively into what NMS is and whether it is the right game for you. It may very well not be. But you don't need to feel guilty about buying a game from a supposedly unethical dev. That just ain't how it is.Addendum (July 25th| 2018): The NEXT update is now available. After my time with it so far| and after having read through the changelist| I am beyond impressed. I was already cautiously optimistic for it| but this feels and looks like an entirely new game. It is as if they have transformed it into its own sequel... if that makes any sense. There are too many changes to list| much less choose to focus on here| so see them for yourself on the official website.There are a few weird bugs they need to iron out as of this writing| but nothing major.Considering the current half-off sale and the new expansion| I can confidently say that this may be the perfect time to get into No Man's Sky. This is the game in a form that really lives up to its potential. And what's exciting| is that there's apparently even more on the way.I really could not be more pleased.But Sean| please fix my Korvax's face-screen!
Recommended,Posted: April 26,-Likes-1: The freedom in this game is spectacular. You can go from planet to planet mining and exploring. There's an upside and a downside to this however| and I will address it more in the dislike section. 2: I like how you can modify not only your weapon but you can modify your exosuit and starship/freighter as well. In order to do so| it takes time and thought into what materials you will need for each upgrade/item.3: The ability to grow in the game regarding upgrades and learning new tech is amazing| and I love how every time I play I have the chance to learn something new about the game.4: They are still updating this game and I don't see any reason why they should stop either. As long as it keeps drawing in players I think this game will stick around for awhile.-Dislikes-1: Addressing #1 in likes: most of the planets feel the same. I understand that the scope of this game is so complex that it would require a ton of memory and data on the developers part in order to make each and every planet unique. With that said| they did do a good job with keeping the planets some-what unique. I would like to see some updates in the future that have more combative alien types along with some new playable species as well.2: One of the biggest disappointments for me was the fact that when you do modify and upgrade your starship/freighter| you don't see the results on the outside of the ship. For example| when I add a rocket launcher on my ship the ship should reflect that modification and show it somewhere on the ship itself. The biggest reason I started playing this game was for the starships and exploration| so needless to say| it was a little disappointing when I found out that ship doesn't change at all when I add new weapons and gear. The only way to change the look of your ship is to buy a different looking ship.That's it for now. I'll have more to come later.
Recommended,Posted: August 15| 2019,The Hello Games is doing exactly what other developers and publishers should be doing| offering a full game that they support and make right even after a bumpy release.  I only purchased this game recently| almost 3 years after release| but I did so because the developers keep pumping out high quality content for free.  That sort of behavior needs to be rewarded in this current EA/Bethesda micro transaction| horse armor| overpriced DLC| random box of crap unlock| nightmare of a gaming world that we find ourselves in.  I really enjoy this game; there is a lot of fun activity and it is good value for the cost.
Recommended,Posted: November 29| 2019,I have been playing video games since the 70's| long before home video game consoles| but no game has been able to capture my attention as No Man's Sky| to be able to live a virtual life as a space explorer has been a dream of mine for years| this game is jam packed with missions and things to do and the Devs have been on the ball to keep upgrading the game and making it better. Come visit my base at FACE-SUNSET-BALLOON-BUG-SUNSET-ECLIPSE-VOXEL-GALAXY-TREE-ECLIPSE-BOAT-TENT there is over 13 million in units waiting for you there. Keep up the great work No man's Sky Devs. I salute you! this game was money well spent!!
Recommended,Posted: March 24,I currently have around 140 hours in on the game| and it's taken me this long to decide if I like it or hate it.  It's a very slow grind and never enough inventory space to carry the very basics.  I'll admit I "Rage Quit" at least once!  My expectations of where I needed to be to where I thought I was supposed to be at the time and timing was way off.  Very very slow going for the first 80 hours or so| even with doing all missions and things you're supposed to do.  Frustrating at first| and again a very slow climb to a decent place| "Opening Up More Inventory Space & Storage| but once you get there the game feels and looks Absolutely Awesome!!!... Now| my PRO'S to the game.  This game has been around for around 4 years.  They constantly and continually upgrade the game| and you are Never charged for a single upgrade!  There is currently No pay them for better looking gear!  And| once you get your very own Freighter the game gets Really Really Good!!!  Lots of personal customizations you can do to your base inside your freighter| you can have virtually unlimited custom bases throughout the galaxy| and can own up to 6 ships in a plethora of styles and attributes.  The Sky is the limit!  I give this game a high 5!!!

Recommended,Posted: January 18| 2019,For Those Who TL:DRPros:- Vivid 1970's styles and visuals almost as if it was out of a Sci-Fi art book.- Procedurally generated worlds| far more then a person can possibly explore in a life time.- Great procedurally mixed music| performed by 65daysofstatic.- Can own up to 6 ships and a colossal capital ship with up to 30 escort frigates.- Exocraft for land and sea (don't have to always walk everywhere)- Base building - Co-op Play (up to 4 players)- Few bugs a seen as of this writing.Cons: - Not much story- Very repetitive structures- Side quests are largely repetitive.- Can't sell ships once you have the maximum (you can trade them for others though).- Game can feel a little bit repetitive at times.Ideas/Suggestions for the Developer:- The ability to sell ships- Build your own Space Station- Upgrade ships and freighter cargo in a discovered ship yard similar to how exo suits are upgraded.- Upgrades for the suit to survive space and be able to space walk with thrusters and magnet boots on freighters and frigates.- Discover procedurally generated tombs| pyramids| structures| monuments| dungeons| etc as well as the current monoliths. Just more diversity in structures to discover.- For wealthy systems| procedurally generated vast explorable cities with a massive space port maybe capable of landing freighters. And perhaps owning your own shop to sell resources and warehouses for those resources. Something else to do in between exploring.Review for those who read:No Man's Sky is a marvel of mathematic procedural engineering. The algorithm uses fractal formulas that are observed in the real world/universe. Texuring| models| music| everything running from a single procedural 16 bit seed (a phone number no less). With 18(10)^10 planets| spread across 255 galaxies| to visit. If you were to visit each planet| each second| it would take you 570|000|000|000 years| approximately 42 times the age of the universe. This is a big game| but I digress. This review isn't just about how technically impressive the game is. The art is vivid and colorful| all inspired by the art of Sci-Fi artists of the 70's and 80's| such as Ralph McQuarrie| Paul Lehr| Bob Eggleton| and John Berkey. The picturesque vistas| the styles of the ships| and the colorful nebula/gas clouds (even one system apparently is in an all blinding red gas cloud) inspire the need to explore. No Man's Sky is a procedurally generated sandbox where you explore solar systems and planets. It has a light story arc and generated side quests. NMS isn't scripted like many games and due to the vast scale scale of the universe no in game story could be big enough. Although it wouldn't hurt to have something like a 100 hour plot for the game but that would detract from what the game is actually about| exploration. Being basically an exploration sandbox| every planet is different and is generally a fresh new experience each time. NMS has a little bit for almost everyone. You can go after bounties| be a space pirate and attack freighters for resources| base building| economy play (no where near the extent of EVE) and co-op play. Despite the technical achievement| visuals| and exploration aspects. There are a few things that NMS falls short. Being procedural| the game can be very samey. Each planet will generate procedurally on a fractal formula which will fallow similar repeated patterns for most systems (I mean com'on| it's a planet| it's going to have creatures| plants| terrain| and a sky). No planet or star system is exactly the same but will always feel a little similar and familiar. A lot of the structures found on a planet's surface are largely the same| follow similar patterns and offer very little variety. I tend to feel a bit bored after a while seeing the same structures over and over again. I want to discover strange new alien structures explorable with treasures in them and see vast sprawling procedurally generated cities with massive space ports| which I'm surprised aren't added for wealthy systems. Regardless of the patterning for an average planet| there are planets with absurd if not drug induced  features. There are planets with floating land masses| vast oceans| strange objects scattered across the land| and in my experience I found a planet with pink landscape| a purple sky and nothing but dancing mushrooms as lifeforms. Also I found a planet that was nothing but a boiling| acidic| toxic ocean. Whatever you choose to get out of this game| whether it is to explore the vast number of systems| or attempt to travel to each galaxy. No Man's Sky is an overall great experience. Personally| I waited a while to get this game due to its rocky launch| but it has grown and changed since then.  The developer| Hello Games| is still adding free content and features. It's not quite it's $60 (USD) price tag but hopefully with future improvements and updates it will be worth so much more then that. As of now I recommend getting it on sale| as I did.
Not Recommended,Posted: September 20| 2016,I gave this game the benefit of the doubt. Unfortunately I gave it that benefit a little too long to refund| and I regret to say I regret that. I'd heard a lot of bad news by the beginning| but to be honest I wasn't looking for much in NMS I didn't think I could get better elsewhere (Star Citizen/Elite). What drew me to NMS anyway was character| or rather the character I expected. As much as I love space trader sims| I really wanted a space game to express the impression of scale and solitude provided by a good astronomy lecture or binge session of Cosmos| and I thought NMS might be the game to do it. Unfortunately life| sapient and otherwise| is so ubiquitous that even if it lived up to its perported diversity it couldn't manage to be awe inspiring. Contact with sapient life is guarenteed on a per system basis| and as such it's too common to be a respite from solitude and too bland to offer a sense of companionship if there had been solitude to begin with. There was a lot of potential in the language system| and I was and still am happy to see a space game finally address the language barrier. Very engaging stories could have been told with that system| even procedurally. Two individuals with virtually no similarities physically so much as culturally meet each other and are the only two individuals for lightyears? Perhaps the only two examples of biological life for lightyears? They speak with one another with clumsy and sloppy symbols if only to communicate an emotion for the first time in months? There really didn't have to be much. As it was| there was too much. To be honest some of the random building encounters could even begin to communicate that sense| but after the fifth in a few miles let alone a few light years| and with so little to learn about each of them| I just couldn't find much of a reason to keep looking.In conjunction with solitude| I expected scale. It's difficult to communicate scale without being extraordinarily boring; I understand that subject is difficult to approach| and that I have greater taste for long-haul flying than the average gamer. That said| there are a lot of stopgap measures that can go a long way to making a reasonably navicable universe feel as big as it really is. Elite is a good example of a lot of them. Having played both games| one of the things that works most in Elite's favor in that regard is the interstellar navigation system. In elite| star systems are spacially relevant to one another. You can even navigate between them in real time at high C numbers if you're patient. Generally you never end up flying between them in real time| but it's important to the sense of scale to know you can. It provides tangible evidence that the systems you visit are actual places| not just another set of planets in the same skybox. One of the simplest examples of such a measure is elite's hyperspace system| which you normally use for interstellar navigation. Ultiamtely| after all the technobabble| you teleport. You are| however| required to face your target to do so| and I've found that little rule means a lot more to a sense of tangibility than I ever expected. Unfortunately NMS falls victim to teleport syndrome| and visiting a new system doesn't feel so much like travel as it does a map switch. I really wanted NMS to be the game to satisfy the part of you that| when out camping somewhere| looks up at the Milky Way and knows that each point of light is as real a place as the ground you sit on| and that collectively| even as they comprise nearly all you can see from Earth| the lot of them are virtually negligable in the local group| which is in turn virtually negligable to Laniakea. I wanted the awe of looking at hubble deep field photos and understanding that those bright lights aren't stars| but galaxies. I never expected great gameplay from NMS| but I expected to feel small. I'm sorry to say that I didn't.Go mess around with Space Engine.
Recommended,Posted: October 30| 2018,Where do I begin? No Man's Sky was a big disappointment after its release but things have changed. I really love what they made out of it. They did not just throw it away like a hot potato and its actually decent. If it lives up to your expectations or not is for you to decide. But after all those updates| after all this content and after all the struggle the game and the developer went through I can say that this game has earned its place in my library and I've grown fond of it. The price might or might not be a deal breaker but keep in mind that the current updates are all free. No hiding behind paywalls and stuff which is a huge plus point. Currently downloading the "Abyss Update" lets see what it got. I'll be updating the review if there is something critical in my view. But currently? I'd say its not a bad game. Go grab it when its on sale. I doubt you are doing something wrong| but the worst you can do is to expect too much from it. Even if it does not fill your expectations for the moment| they are working hard for it to do so| so stop insulting the developers they are doing everything in their might to atone for what they have done.Edit: If you have trouble with the deep sea quest for the abyss| give it time. After a while of playing and doing a couple of quests it appeared all of a sudden.Edit: I hereby nominate No Man's Sky for the "Labor of Love" Award. They sure deserve it.
Recommended,Posted: September 18| 2018,No Man's Sky...is an exploration and crafting survival game. Waking up on an unknown planet with no memory of your past and a crashed spacecraft with cryptic or fragmentary information| you set out to survive the environment and explore the Euclid Galaxy one planet at the time| as you define your purpose. This review takes into all updates up until Visions.⚙ Game Description & Mechanics ⚙Gameplay is focused on gathering resources and crafting objects. You begin with a basic multitool and limited inventory space| and learn to mine for crafting material to fix your equipment and recharge your life-support and hazard protection shields. As you progress| you'll learn recipes to more advanced components to build devices| refine basic elements| craft equipment upgrades for your multitool| exosuit and spacecraft| and even build a base (or multiple bases).Much of No Man's Sky revolves around exploring and cataloguing all you discover. Scanning each mineral| flora and fauna found on each planet will identify the resource it supplies as well as give you Units (trade currency) for each you scan for the first time| while uploading them to the servers will give you Nanite Clusters (tech currency). Units can be used to purchase material and components from the Galactic Trade Network| as well as better multitools| spacecrafts and frigates. Nanite Clusters are used to purchase equipment blueprints and upgrade modules. As the galaxy is shared among all players| you get to name any system| planet| waypoint| animal or plant you're the first player to scan| forever leaving your mark in the game for the next player to fly by this system and land on the planet.Progression is done in multiple ways. After the introduction (which also serves as a tutorial)| you can follow the Path of Atlas which sets you to eventually reach the center of the galaxy. You may instead set your focus on the single-player campaign where you retrace the footsteps of another Traveller like you. Of course| you can ignore both options and advance at your own pace| finding alternative ways to unlock the game's content. For instance| you can unlock base building component blueprints from burried salvage technologies and from side-missions given to you by your in-base specialists. Once you have a freighter| your crew will give you missions for your fleet of frigates (which you send on exploration| trading or combat missions). Those seeking a bigger challenge can do all that in Survival or Permadeath modes.☺ What I enjoyed ☺It's hard to express just how much there is to do in this game! In the early game| your limited equipment and inventory space will force you to struggle through a slow progression| but the entry grind has a satisfaction of its own once you acquire additional cargo space to store spare consumable and specialized material| upgrade your multitool and exosuit with a variety of weapon modules| better shields| enhanced environmental protection and various specialized equipment. Once you accumulate a good reserve of Units| trading your spacecraft for a bigger| stronger or faster one will only accelerate the process.Base building is also very satisfying if you're into this. You can build anywhere| and the base's size cap is very high. The base can serve as headquarters with additional storage space| a farm to produce rare material| a gathering place for you and up to 3 of your friends (the base itself can be built as a team)| build racing tracks for use with your exocrafts (land vehicles you can| of course| build and upgrade!) and then upload it to the online servers or the Steam Workshop. Getting a freighter (from which you control your fleet and store multiple spacecrafts) serves as a mobile base of its own| part of which you can alter and build in to your liking.It's a gorgeous game| the constant updates since launch brought improvements to textures| procedural generation algorithms and overall graphical technology upgrades. The quantity of biomes allows quite the diversity: dry and dusty deserts| cold and icy snow plains| lush and humid forests| barren and rocky landscapes| foggy and poisonous fungal plains| to name a few| and I'm leaving out some of the most obscure| eccentric or over-the-top planets you can find in red star| green star and blue star systems. New creature types| from small to humongous| can be found on these| once again proceedurally-generated from head to toe| with actual per-planet coherence.☹ What bothered me ☹As mentioned before| it's a game about resource-gathering and crafting. This means a lot of grind| hour upon hour of mining and refining your resources. Want to build a huge base? Grind for building material. Want to make a lot of money? Grind for valuable resources. Want to survive a hostile environment? Grind for life support and environmental protection fuel. If you don't enjoy this kind of stuff| you will find it terribly tedious. The change of pace from story missions| base building missions and sidequest missions is limited as they can also feel very repetitive| even with the efforts made by the developers with the week-long community events.PvP and PvE combat mechanics| whether on the ground or in space| are less than optimal. The ingredients all appear to be there: various weapon types and grenades for ground| various weapon types and missiles for space| the run/strafe/jump mechanics| yet somehow it still feels off and doesn't even come close to games dedicated to either types of combat. So while you "can" be a pirate and fight frigates| or you "can" be a hunter fighting predators and sentinels| it's barely worth the trouble and seems to have been included as an afterthought. The single-player campaign is somewhat simple and feels like a goose chase of travelling from one location to another| grinding| digging or building specific upgrades to continue to the next clue. Learning the alien languages| one word at a time| has little payoff. Most of the galaxy lore| given through snippets of history found in monoliths or conversations with stationary NPCs| will feel superficial to anyone who doesn't want to do the roleplaying in his head. If you can't set your own objectives and strictly rely on the fun of exploring| you will start seeing repeating patterns in the procedural generation of planets' flora and fauna as soon as you've been on a couple of systems.My Verdict: ★★★★☆ - "Next on your list!"No Man's Sky isn't a space combat simulator| nor a sci-fi adventure: it is first and foremost an exploration and crafting survival game| in the veins of ARK: Survival Evolved (although the multiplayer isn't quite there| yet) and Subnautica. However| a lot of people are looking for a game that does just that. You'll find a lot to do| it isn't even humanly possible to discover the entire galaxy (even if all players worked together in an attempt to do so). With all the updates so far and those to come| it definitely delivers!P.S.: I was lucky enough to avoid the pre-launch hype| but I do understand the disappointment and frustration caused by Hello Games' marketing| promising features that wouldn't actually make it in the game until years from launch. And while I can appreciate the dedication of the team not to have run away with the money and actually delivering on their promises| I can't forget nor forgive that easily| and you can be sure I'll never pre-purchase anything this studio releases.—————————————————————————This was just my opinion.If you found this review helpful| please consider giving it a thumbs up| and feel free to check out more of my (purely opinionated) reviews.
Not Recommended,Posted: September 21| 2016,Sean Murray| thx you a lot.You taught me not to trust screenshots| videos and promises of developers before release of the game.You taught me not to buy something on prerelease to get some reward (especially that breaks the game)You taught me not to play game more than 2 hours to see| what else developers didn't include in the game.You taught me if game has a lot of bugs| crashes| FPS drops| bad optimization| localization - this is good reason to refund it| but not wait for fixes.You taught me never trust you and Hello games. I paid the price for this knowledge in full.
Recommended,Posted: June 26,Probably the biggest redemption in the videogame history.You have many things to craft and do right now| missions can get repetitive but for example| i spent 25h+ just building| expanding and upgrading my base. Played some co-op missions and free exploration which made it even more fun.I watched this video and 30 seconds after the video ended I bought the game| so If you have some doubts| give it a try.Definitely worth on sale.Thank you Hello Games.
Recommended,Posted: June 24| 2018,After arguably the most over-hyped and disappointing release of all time| the developers could have taken the money and run. But they didn't. They could have updated the game only through paid DLC. But they didn't. Instead| they have set themselves the task of realising what I assume was their original vision| before it was completely derailed by the hype train. And they are making it available to all buyers for free| including the upcoming multiplayer patch.The game itself still isn't perfect. Its grindy| somewhat simplistic and saddled with what is probably one of the worst inventory systems I have ever had the misfortune to use. At the same time though| it genuinely rewards exploration and doles out intriguing snippets of backstory across multiple plot threads. Together| these aspects prevent the game from sinking into a mire of generic procedural generation. There is always one more thing to do; build a new base| buy a new ship| visit a new planet type| craft a new item. Even after over a hundred hours I still haven't purchased a freighter. Rather than rush| I have whiled away the hours cruising between planets| seeing the sights and deciding how I want to shape the galaxy.HG have finally earned the asking price.EDIT: Since I reviewed this| there have been three major content updates| all free.
Recommended,Posted: January 14,Yes| I got this after watching the internet historian video.I wanted to buy this when it came out because I like the rest of the internet was hyped about it| but since I have a rule of not buying games in the first six month after they launch| I didn't and I was glad that I didn't because it was a mess and a disappointment. For a while I forgot about it and then the video came out that made me feel confident about the game and go buy it.This was not a mistake| the game is amazing| I never feel like I don't have anything to do| I don't feel like I'm grinding for stuff| I don't feel like what I'm doing is repetitive even when sometimes it is.There is always a sense of progression in the game| a sense of purpose and accomplishment.If it's just researching new tech to spec out your base or if it's chasing knowledge stones to learn an alien language to help you communicate with NPC's. Finding crashed ships to salvage and maybe melt for credits later. Discovering ancient ruins and temples. Exploring new and weird planets.I played 33 hours in 4 days| that's about all you need to know to buy this.Hello Games is an example of a studio that cares about the games they make and this game is a labor of love.
Not Recommended,Posted: October 28| 2016,The game creates the illusion that it is going somewhere for a few hours and then begins to become a grind... which works for a lot of titles. The grind can be welcome. Look at Minecraft| MMOs| Warframe and even games with ranked matches. People love to grind to improve| or collect or move forward. That is not what I am talking about when I talk about NMS.The grind in NMS is a grind without reason or goal. You simply exist to repeat the same pointless acts until you get bored... the reason there is such a tidal wave of rage is because you get sick of this 60+ dollar game extremely quickly.Pros: Reading up on the lore for the races is interesting.Cons: I didn't pay 60 dollars for a comic book length read about 3 alien races.Space combat is terrible and feels like it was never tested.Where are the goals?No end game.No mid game.Creatures are all frankenstein combinations of the same parts. Scanning birds is buggy and doesn't react fast enough. General advice is to just kill them and scam the corpse.Worlds are ugly and garish due random asset dumping without thought or care.It is designed to be a timesink and only a timesink. Your money is better spent elsewhere.If you absolutely feel the need to buy this| try to stop playing before 2 hours and really contemplate if it is worth keeping... they didn't put up a "we don't offer refunds outside of the rules" warning sticker on the store page for a while for no reason. This game looks and plays nothing like advertised and worse than that| barely functions as a game. Maybe if it sold for 20USD it could be justified... maybe. 1/10 refund simulator| stops working if you leave it on too long while googling when the fun is supposed to start.
Recommended,Posted: February 14,I have mixed feelings about this game. Yes| it is worth the money| i would recommend it| and i enjoyed most of my time spent playing it. The game was created by a very small team| a big point i kept in consideration while typing this. However| i feel compelled to bring up a few contraries and what it lacks.  When you first start| you are overwhelmed with everything in the game (objectives| features| scenery| amount of star systems to explore| etc). There is so much to do and you just jump in and try to do it all| and its exhilarating. But after you reach a certain point| you realize the game is somewhat empty and there's nothing left to do. Nothing in the game is challenging; no dangerous creatures| battles| or encounters that would even remotely make you ponder if you're in danger and need to use your brain. End-game crafting/building is achieved too quickly and making money/nanites becomes boringly easy.  To me| the storyline was bland| silly| and annoying. More times than not| i found myself trying to fast-click through all the unnecessary dialogue (dialogue to a story that lost my interest very quickly) so i could enjoy the rest of the game.  The sheer amount of star systems they made in this game is overwhelming and is a marvel that could set a new standard in the gaming industry. No one will be able to explore even a fraction of all of the star systems and each one is different. With that said| the catch is all of stars/planets are auto-generated and there's not nearly enough variety/variables in the generator to make each new star or planet you visit feel like its new| but just a mashup of content you've previously explored. With all said| i still recommend this game. It is worth the money. Breathtaking scenery all over. A game you can enjoy while relaxing. But there is no "game" in the game. There is very little challenge to it. Nothing in it will exercise your brain to think critically or inductively.
Not Recommended,Posted: October 9| 2016,No Man's Sky| one of the worst scams of the 21st century.-This game features 18 quintillion planets| they look the same and have the same glitches| resources and bugged creatures.-Aliens that have no meaning| besides having very slow paced conversations| they do nothing.-Space battles? They are a lie| the worst spacecraft vs spacecraft system I could have ever imagined.-Factions? They give you a minor discount on items| faction vs faction doesn't exist.-Survival? A pointless grind| the resource you need to survive is always nearby.-Adventure? More like exploration without any dangers.-Epic soundtrack? After 2 hours you will disable it and use your own music.-Achievements? Never before has earning achievements been annoying| they interrupt your gameplay.-Epic ending? It's the same as an empty box| there is nothing.-Reasons to buy this game?-No reason.
Recommended,Posted: June 14| 2019,Rough rough poor startoff to a game that could be endless and peaceful. Exploration done right(procedural generated planets|plants|critters|minerals and more). Trading done well(mining systems|manufacturing planets| power source planets| etc...)| Fleets built for fun(30 frigates max to do extra missions for you ) and to increase your economy and rare materials.   Personal starships.. rewarding(several different classes ranging from fighter| shuttle| haulers| exotics.    This is the sci fi game I've been wanting. Not exactly realistic| but "arcadey" enough for a casual. Spent 200hrs (currently plan for MOAR) and have an addiction to screenshots like no other. I had a steam friend that said this is the most screenshotiest game ever. I agree even tho screenshotiest isn't a word.
Recommended,Posted: August 12| 2017,Updated for No Man's Sky 1.5 NEXT:After launch| I waited quietly.They added bases| and I waited.They added vehicles| and I waited.They added a camera| which was silly but I liked it| and then I waited.Now Atlas Rises came out| I find myself READING to LEARN things about the LORE. I want to keep exploring because planets have CLASSES now. I fell into a cave that was filled with water. I flew over giant oceans and huge continents| and I haven't even ventured outside a starting solar system yet.With each update| the game becomes more like a first person Starbound and I LOVE IT.NEXT Update:YES. YES. GOOD SALESGEK ALMIGHTY YES.So I have to say| I'm a fan of all the changes. I do see this update still as a foundation tho| which many seem to gloss over. This sets up a solid Mulitplayer foundation. I can be a Gek. Solid new building mechanics. I can be a Gek. World Gen keeps getting better and better. I can be a Gek. Even better tweaked progression... AND I CAN COMMAND A FLEET OF FRIGATES WHILE BEING A GEK.

Recommended,Posted: April 12,In 2016 when No Man's Sky was launched| it was the biggest disappointment and now in 2020 the game is completely different.GOOD+Graphics+Gameplay+18 quintillion planets to explore+Space Open WorldAnd lastly| I want to congratulate the Hello Games for not abandoning this game and they managed to repair and restore it as it had to be from the beginning when it was launched.8.5/10 Must Play!I recommend to buy it at a big discount somewhere at 75-85%
Not Recommended,Posted: August 22| 2016,Let me preface everything by saying that I actually bought this game on impulse before watching the trailers.  I like space| I like exploration| some of the early reviews were positive| so I bought it.  I regret that impulsive decision.    Take it from a 5 year veteran of Eve: Online this game is BORING.  Imagine Eve minus the hordes of players trying to kill you| it's more boring than that.   There is supposed to be septillions of stars and planets generated| but their algorithm is poor. This results in maybe 12 different planet types and 30 animal species. I'm being very generous with the planets| for the most part they are just different colors with a different icon showing you what is killing you today. Now I wasn't expecting Spore like creature variety| but this is insulting. All of them look the same. There might be some slight variation between the crab like species trying to kill me| but I honestly couldn't tell. The entire game is far too easy| in my trek from the start to the center of the galaxy my shields dropped a total of maybe 10 times| I still don't know what the death screen looks like.   The interface is utterly terrible. You have to hold to click EVERYTHING. I cannot fathom a reason this has to be for literally EVERYTHING. The galaxy map is the single worst aspect of the UI| a rather galaring flaw for something that wants to do space exploration. The path to the center is utterly useless| as I got close to the center it literally got stuck in a dead end. It ignores your hyperdrive upgrades meaning it's course will take you through about a dozen short hops and then abruptly stop| while you can reach the end in one jump or infact go much futher. There is a total disconnect between "Distance from Center" and "Linear Distance"| 500ly for the former is about 1|500ly for the latter. You are down to luck for finding any particular location| even ones you've visited before.    The game play is more or less a resource grind| you land on a planet| shoot at a rock with a mining laser| you leave the planet to go shoot at a different rock. There are NPC| they are of three races| all of which just stand or sit alone in one place. They never do anything| you can talk to them and maybe get a blue print or something| but thats it| there is no personality| not even real interaction.  There was an Atlas quest line| that brought you to 10 admittedly rather spiffy looking space stations. Actually I lied| there are 4 rather spiffy looking space stations that are repeated a couple of times in no particular order. It starts no where and ends in a non ending. This may last you a couple of hours (or however long it takes you to realize the map system is trash and just jump to the end). But it pales in comparison to reaching the Galactic Center.  Thats the final insult| what happens at the center. I'll rant in a spoilerific manner after the next paragraph. Suffice to say if we reached the center and had a planet sized MIDDLE FINGER to explore| this would still be less of a ♥♥♥♥ YOU than what we got. Because at least the Flipping Bird of God would be an object of interest and discussion.    It was after I had played for a while that I went out and watched the trailers| holy ♥♥♥♥ I wanted to play that game| too bad it's not what I bought. I'm angry I wasted money buying this| I would have been furious if my expectations were that high. This isn't a case of a fandom hyping in a vacuum| the developers were outright lying to us. Not just in the trailers| but in the words they were speaking. ♥♥♥♥ this game. SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILER SPOILERYou start jumping to the center| the game silently says "nope"| plays prog rock as it holds the scroll backwards button on the map screen| fade to black and dumps you at the start of a new practically identical galaxy with all you stuff broken. I think it might even have gotten the color on my ship wrong. I can't tell because my game bugged out and put me in slow mo| and I was already fighting the urge to just toss my computer out a window. So no| you don't even get to see what is so shiny at the center of the universe| you just start over again.    Seriously ♥♥♥♥ this game.
Not Recommended,Posted: August 15| 2016,"A mile wide but an inch deep" was the title of Haedox's review| and a good one sentence summary of No Man's Sky. Since its release on PC| the amount of negative mobilization against the developer has been alarming| and overly harsh. However| behind the slandering and swinging punches there are some basic valid points. Two of which are that is was indeed released too early on PC| and it is overpriced. But for me| neither of these are why I'm not recommending the game at this time. The main issue with the game is in its DNA. Whilst being procedural allows for everything to be different| this randomness is still limited by the depth of its algorithms. Visit 1 planet and you've essentially seen all 18 Quintillion - Colours| animations| flora and fauna may be randomized| but it all starts to look roughly the same. You start to see the parameters set by the algorithms - eg. placement of objects and resources| max terrain elevation. And this problem with depth is not just aesthetic| it affects the biological and geographic complexity and interactivity - extreme temperature shifts should be reflected in the flora and fauna| life should spring up around pockets of liquid on barren planets| a two ton dinosaur shouldnt walk on the hind legs of a bird. Whilst randomness may seem like a great way of creating a whole universe| the reality is our own universe is anything but random - rather a series of interconnected and relative processes. This is what makes it interesting to discover| and what is lacking in the NMS approach. For a game that relies on exploration as a key motivator to play| I just don't feel like I'm discovering anything spectacular or original. The first three hours of the game were fantastic. Good premise - ship has crashed| needs repair. A new alien world to discover - your time on the first planet is really brilliant - taking in excellent sound design| strange plants| spotting your first creature. However once you arrive at your second| third| and fourth| you start to realise that the game's main incentive - to discover new worlds| simply doesn't hold up under the weight of procedural limitations. The interactions with aliens are entertainingly worded| but again| shallow and repetitive| as is resource collection and trade. These galactic duties are perhaps repetitive in reality| true| but where's the sense of danger in walking a few hundred meters to get that mineral| whilst the temperature is dropping 2 degrees a second? Where's the fear when you enter a planet's atmosphere| wondering if your ship will hold together? I can't really 'feel' that sense of exploration.These are my criticisms| and something that I hope can be resolved. Sean Murray had the very best of intentions for our collective experience in NMS| I sincerely believe that. and you can see them throughout his creation - however| I can't help but feel that the game would have been more interesting if it wasn't entirely procedural - A single star system| where getting to your home planet was key - each planet uniquely different| with bordered 'maps' like Destiny| rich with unique plant life and atmosphere. As a discovery and exploration game| that would have been incredible. It makes me long to relive that first thrilling walk along the lonely coast of Dear Esther.So should you buy the game? I will say this| make an assessment based on what I've mentioned in this review| but regardless of your decision| consider that the small team responsible wanted to build the game that WE wanted NMS to be| and perhaps they'll get there. But regardless| respect has to be paid for dreaming and aiming big.
Recommended,Posted: February 18,THE GAME:I Love this game| but it is not for the hard combat orientated gamer. You travel around the Galaxy discovering an endless amount of planets; do biological/geological/archaeological research; mine for resources; upgrade/modify your spacecraft| buy a fleet of them and also a fleet of freighters. You can take missions from the Space station in each system as well as other places. Build up your cash| so that you can upgrade your equipment and buy cool useful or decorative items. Base Building can be a major part of the game if you want it to. There are many players that spend hours designing and building their bases and a lot of them look incredible. You can furnish them and add technological equipment and consoles| that are usable and useful. Build in the sky| terrain and underwater. You can also have a land/underwater base hybrid along a shore line| even build in a large cave.. You can even tame and farm animals. Taming some animals gives you the ability to ride them.Storage facilities is a must have. You have storage in your space craft and freighters and terrain-based craft as well as your EVA suit. Manage your stock well as you might start running out of space| but there is plenty of storage available. At first you might think that you have more storage than what you need| but later you'll have to make decisions on what stock is most important to you. If you don't need it| sell it. You can always find it later if required. It varies depending on what mode you play the game in like Normal mode| Survivor mode or Really freakin' ultra hard mode.You have various ground based vehicles in which you can use to cruise the terrain and find resources to scan such as vegetation| minerals and fauna which in turn provide you with credits (cash). Mining valuable resources is also a cash-grabber. Various metals and minerals are also required for building| repairing| upgrading and surviving| not just selling.You can engage in warfare with pirates in space and Sentinals on the surface of planets or just ignore them if it's not your cup of tea. Fair warning though; if a sentinal or Pirate has it in for you| you either fight them or run; your choice.There are various missions and quests you can choose to do or not to do. You play the game the way you want to. You can take your time and explore or you can go head long into it and move through the game at a much quicker pace. Weather you choose to follow the story-line (sort of like a campaign) or do your own thing; you can.WHO WOULD LIKE THIS GAME?I recommend this to older players who just like to get home from work and relax for a while| cruising in space and checking out planets| building your base| mining or going on an adventure. For me it's a very zen like experience. If you are in your teens and like games where you are level 50 and like to destroy and pillage some poor dudes level 1 base while he's at work and take items which you don't need because you are beyond that point| then this game is not for you. Find something else.VRIf you have quality VR equipment| you might also want to check this game out. I don't play it in VR.  From the discussions that I have read on it; for some it is awesome and with others frustrating and below par. I guess it's all in the quality and compatibility of the VR software/hardware that you have. Best do your homework on it first before deciding to buy it purely for its VR capability.SMALL DOWNSIDEThe only downside is that it can sometimes feel a little repetitive. For me I don't care. I just go and play another game for a while| but I always seem to gravitate back to this game and carry on where I left off. It just depends on what sort of mood i'm in. Got to keep your options open I say.If you are playing the beta version of OSIRIS: NEW DAWN and like it| then I imagine you would like NMS as well.Visually it is stunning. Can't say much more about that part.MY RATING:  9/10
Recommended,Posted: May 14,No Man's Sky. A game whose launch was marred with controversy. In 2016| it seemed as though those who had pre-ordered or purchased the game had been tricked| backstabbed| and| quite possibly| bamboozled.Now| the game is a far cry from its release version. Multiplayer has been added with recent updates| as well as a wide swath of quality-of-life and gameplay updates. Had this been the game released four years ago| No Man's Sky would have had a much better release.This being said| I find the story to be quite lacking| and have spent the majority of my time building| exploring| and the like. In this regard| No Man's Sky is a must for those who enjoyed Subautica's base building and exploration aspects| with enough challenge to keep the game interesting but not terribly difficult.However| when I got the game| it was still selling for $60. In my not-so-humble opinion| that is a bit steep for this game| and so I bought it on sale for $30. On sale| this game is well worth the cost; elsewise| I would not purchase it.
Recommended,Posted: November 28| 2018,No Man's Sky had one of the roughest releases of any game I had ever seen. The game felt unfinished and hollow. It had extremely negative feedback and felt like a scam after all of the hype and buildup to those of us who preordered. These facts are what make this game so impressive today. After constant fixes| patches| and 12 huge free updates| this game is extraordinary and one of my favorites by far. And the free updates| which add dozens of hours of new content each| only keep coming. My hat is off to the amazing development team at Hello Games for listening to the community and showing that not all game developers are solely in it for the money. Thanks again for this wonderful masterpeice.
Not Recommended,Posted: August 23| 2016,This game has endless possiblities. Almost all of which are not featured in this game. I had a great time playing this game.For the first 8 hours and then it was just a grind. I just couldn't stop playing it. Mostly because I hoped for something awesome at the center. But there is literally nothing at the center.  It actually takes things away from you instead.I got all the achievements But| I still don't have all of the blueprints. Message Found| Message Already Learned This Game is great at wasting your time.18/18quintillion Would recommend tossing this game into a blackhole.
Recommended,Posted: March 26| 2019,I bought the game without jumping on the hype train. My pre-order was literally the night before launch| and only to get the bonus DLC Horizon Omega ship and the extra starting units. And while I can understand that a lot of people had their hearts broken in August 2016| (I'll admit I found the game lacklustre and samey after my first 20 hours) the team at HG have worked so hard to regain the trust they lost. Now we're being given VR support and MMO-styled online features for free!I've now played over 1000 hours across Gog and Steam. The reason I've played it so much is that the devs have continued to add content; a trail of breadcrumbs which lead the player on a grand adventure through the cosmos and a lot more new things to do to the universe| making it feel more alive with every update. NEXT (1.5) changed everything; I was starting to get bored with Atlas Rises (1.3) at about 450 hours in| but so much was added and had changed that a refresh of the game with all the new content allowed me to sink a further 560 very enjoyable hours into exploring| crafting| building| meeting other players and building enormous bases on any planet of my choosing| anywhere at all.That wasn't even the end| we received "The Abyss" content update just days before Halloween adding to the game something of a Subnautica angle| and shortly after that in November we received yet another content update called Visions which introduced new biomes| new systems such as salvage| archaeology. And through all this| they even found time to add a whole season of new content provided through community-based missions asking us to work together towards a common in-game goal.I think now| the public's perception of the game has finally begun to turn around. Haters are few and far between. And while the game is still not a masterpiece| I have faith in the ability and commitment of the devs. I believe one day it will be considered one of the greatest games of our time.

Recommended,Posted: August 11| 2019,Yeah so| if you ignore everything you were ever told about the game| and buy it on sale half off| then it's one of the best returns on money spent you can get. Play for a quick hour or two before bed to help you calm down. Come home from a ♥♥♥♥♥♥ stressful day at work? This is the game I want to play. Idk... I'm not 14 anymore. I don't want twitchy shooters| and I don't have enough time to invest in giant over-arching storylines that suck me in and require me to remember what happened 8 hours beforehand. This is a good game.
Recommended,Posted: November 5| 2018,I thought they were just going to take the money and run with it| but it seems the developers of this game truly wanted to make what they promised| and have been supporting the game for 2 years now. This game seems to be made with a lot more love than what I see in a lot of other games| even if it's initial launch shows otherwise.

Recommended,Posted: July 25| 2018,I fed a dinosaur and it smiled at me10/10
Not Recommended,Posted: March 24| 2017,Let's get a couple things out of the way first. Number one| this is going to be one of the most honest reviews you'll see on this game. I'm not a troll| I'm not a fan boy... I said I would buy this game when its price was lowered to less than $40 and that's exactly what I did for the experience alone.Now| before I can discuss the various aspects of the game I need to address the elephant in the room and get past it first. No Man's Sky is one of the biggest lies that I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong| this wont affect my review| but it needs to be said. Sean Murray is one of the most deceptive| and despicable developers I have ever seen. He blatantly lied on national television| online| etc about features in this game that don't exist (even now many months after release). It's why the dev team is/was being investigated in the UK for false advertising. Don't take my word for it| search "No Man's Lie" or "One Man's Lie" and you'll find all the evidence you need.That said| below is my review of the game. If you want a shortened version| just skip to the final verdict at the bottom.OverviewThe game throws you onto a planet and giving you a waypoint to your crashed ship with very little else to go on. You have a mining tool| probably a failing suit to the environment (acid rain| cold| heat| etc)| and need to struggle to survive while repairing your ship. Once repaired| the galaxy is your limit. There is absolutely no hand holding here| it will be a struggle (on survival mode).GraphicsThis game is visually "beautiful"... but also extremely ugly at the same time. Looking at planets and walking around them looks amazing. The effects looking around and flying are fantastic. But the ground textures are EXTREMELY blurry| planets look one way in space and as you get closer change drastically. AA effects are choppy| and animals look almost made out of clay. There are some significant graphics issues with this game that takes away from the experience (even when maxed out).StorylineThis game features an almost non-existent storyline. You get a main questline to obtain recipes... but it's not very up front and doesn't really do anything to tell a story. You don't understand these new races| and don't feel like you're apart of their struggle. You never find out why you're there| or what you were up to. You don't get a grasp of the galaxy and how it's laid out and just move from one system to another to eventually get to the center (which| the outcome is absolute trash and swift kick in your pants).Side QuestingThere are a LOT of side things you can do in this game| not really quests so much as "give one of -these- to an alien" who in turn gives you reputation or recipes. Or learning a language word from one of three races. Reputation does absolutely NOTHING for your character or the story. You can't pick sides in a conflict| and you can't change your destiny based on your interactions. The interactions have NO effect what so ever on the galaxy. Once you've collected all of the recipes and brought a cube| or isotope to an alien| it just repeats. Completely repetitve and boring.CombatGeneral combat is fluid and fun. The worst aspect about combat is currently what should be the most important... space combat. Design flaws exist that really have me scratching my head (like the fact that in the middle of a dogfight I need to open my inventory and manually repair my ship while still flying and fighting). No hotkeys| no hot bar| nothing. Incredibly frustrating. Ground combat involves fighting drones (sentinels) or aggressive animals. Pretty bland| but smooth enough. You can pretty much avoid all sentinels by sprinting away from them. They give up looking for you even when standing in an open field in front of them.Skills| and UpgradesNo skills to be had unless it's an upgrade to your multi-tool or ship. Very little in the way of character development and if you find a new tool or ship| that's your instant gratification. Upgrades are crafted| which can be frustrating for people who just want to explore and not grind (farm). Getting ships is also a chore| or expensive depending on how you obtain them.Game PerformanceI run a PC with the following specs:AMD FX-8370 (8 core CPU) @ 4.01ghzG.Skill RAM 16GB @ 1600mhzAsus GTX 1080 8GBWindows 10I can run the game at 30-60fps on 1920 x 1080 with the graphics settings maxed out. Generally I get about 30fps on the ground and 60fps from the air. Which when you look at the blurry textures| the HORRENDOUS pop in (which I've crashed more than once into a cliff face because of how slow the terrain pops in)| short viewing distance| etc... I should be doing a lot better here. I absolutely blow this game away with my specs and yet| it struggles. Definitely in need of a significant optimization pass| even though this game launched as a FULL retail release. Not an alpha.Final VerdictThis game is fun for ONLY two people. Casuals who want to explore and just fly around. Second are hardcore fans. These are guys that stuck with the game from the beginning and don't mind the grind (they'll also defend it with their last breath and probably even vote this review down). But if you're a survivalist| like space games| etc... there are other options out there for you. This game is NOT for you. With the state of the game| poor performance| and other annoying development decisions... I have to downvote this game. Even after the Pathfinder and Base Building updates. 40+ hours into the game and I'm unimpressed. This game should have done two things... been classed as an Early Access game from the start and been priced at $30. This would have saved them from the terrible reviews and they could have explained away the blatant lies with that. But Sean Murray never ONCE explained himself afterwards. He never sat down with the angry consumers and explained why he said there was no multiplayer| large scale fleet battles| and more. If I were him I would have done an ask me anything live (like on Twitch)| and explained everything. If it was Sony to be blamed| he needed to blame them. Something to make people understand WHY. With its pro's and con's and there's too many to fit into my review here (character limits)... I give this game a solid 6/10. It's ALMOST there in terms of being something I could recommend. I followed this game from the first announcement... and it failed on so many levels. I watched the launch| and followed the updates before I recently purchased this. If I hadn't paid less than $40| I would be irrate. I can see why it's rated so low.

They also don't seem to become appreciably more interesting as you move towards the center| if at all. The pool of resources is shallow| and they're spread more or less homogeneously among planets. There are no objects on planets that you will not have seen in an hour or two on your first planet| and no objects in space that can be found through exploration. Explore should be renamed Sightsee| as that's more or less what you're doing when exploring because you quickly run out of significant things to discover.Fight:Ship combat was trivialized by the removal of classes and ship attributes. Large scale space battles were cut as well| and you cannot destroy space stations or freighters as we'd been told. You will fight sentinels and pirates alone| all of which fly ships which are functionally identical to your own. Ground combat occurs with only a few sentinels at a time| and poses no challenge. Fights are easily won| escaped from| or avoided entirely.Trade:Trading offers few benefits outside of selling valuable items to upgrade to better equipment. There are few items you'd actually ever want to buy from a trader| and few things to sell that are worth using an inventory slot on instead of a gold/emeril stack. Grinding for elements/rare items to sell is as far as most will ever go| and money quickly becomes useless in the game. You probably can't play as a space trader exclusively| and trading between systems doesn't seem worth the hassle even if you can. Trading with factions is a non-consideration as you will max out in rep for everyone very quickly. There simply isn't enough elements in the game to support deep trade| as there's little to actually need| and little worth actually selling.Survive:Everything you need for basic survival is bountiful on every planet. Sentinels pose no risk. The only thing that poses any particular risk is extreme planets| and there's zero incentive to even really visit those as they've got nothing you couldn't easily find elsewhere| not that the risk they pose isn't easily mitigated and/or dealt with.As you can see| the game we were told we'd get is a far more feature-rich| complex and dynamic game than the one we actually got. What we got was a static| lifeless and paper thin experience by comparison.I know I have played the game longer than the 2 hour refund peroid| but there was know way to know if any of these features we were sold on were in the game with out longer play time. As you can see I consistently played the game for those 18 hours when it was released. But I have not play it since after finding out all these features we were shown are missing.As well as the missing features there are also performance issues and random crashes of the game. My system specs are as follows.i7 2.67 GHz32GB RamNvidia GeForce GTX1070Windows 7 Professional 64bitI have been a long time Steam member for over 10 years and have a lot of games I have purchased from the platform in those years. This is the first one I have ever bought where I have felt cheated due to the misleading advertising of the game. I will seriously consider purchases with them Steam in future if the refund isn't resolved.I believe on these grounds I am entitled to a full refund.I am live in Netherlands and consumer law states I and entitled to a refund if:Does not match descriptions made by the salesperson| on packaging and labels| and in promotions or advertising.
Recommended,Posted: December 2| 2019,No Man’s Will Visit It All  I was late to the NMS party| but I have been around long enough to see 2 major patches and multiple smaller additions that keep adding to a game that for some time far surpasses what it was advertised to be.‘That video’ of the odd looking creature that was supposedly a representation of the one in the trailer is findable| but so is everything else seen before as well as other variations.That is the beauty of NMS| yes similar planets yield similar Foliage| Fauna| Minerals & a lot will look odd compared to what we perceive as 'normal'. It make's a lot of exploration after 100h+ feel a little deja vu. The true exploration though comes when you find those more unique variations| the ones that you stop for a moment| maybe take a photo or decide to build a base in order to appreciate the many variables that had to be exactly so to make it.This is why I keep playing| amongst other things. The hard truth: 🔸 NMS is not a First Person Shooter| although it has need for it sometime.🔹 NMS is not a Flight Simulator| contour hugging is assisted &| lading/taking off is auto.🔸 NMS is not a Space Dogfight Sim| although it will be needed now n then.🔹 NMS is not a fast paced game| you can spend a lot of time gathering resources| exploring and tracking down blueprints for better gear| ships or planets| especially early on.But that is the point of NMS| it is a journey from being stranded on a planet with no memory and a non functional ship to exploring the far reaches of the galaxy to learn the truth| whilst doing as little or as much as you want with the endless possibilities around you.. In its simplest form NMS is; 🔸 Gather resources to survive and repair [point A]|🔹 Use resources to craft items| & tech to travel further|🔸 Learn how to craft new/better items or tech|🔹 Travel to new systems and progress the above| until you get to [point B] What is possible| and completely optional is; 🔸 Learning 3 different alien dialects to better communicate with them|🔹 Talking| learning from and/or trading with the alien lifeforms|🔸 Story/quest lines for| agriculture| weapons| exocrafts| science and base building|🔹 Exploring ancient Alien sites for insight into their past|🔸 Hacking manufacturing plans to steal blueprints| units or nanites|🔹 Solving numeric codes to unearth amongst other things| distress beacons|🔸 Claiming unoccupied crashed ships and getting them in flying condition|🔹 Scraping said ship for resources and credits| or🔸 Using the ship as a part exchange for another ship|🔹 Completing requests from random AI for items| res or units|🔸 Completing faction quests for bigger rewards| [faction relation levels required]🔹 Cataloging Systems| Planets| Flora| Forna and Minerals for better information|🔸 Uploading the information so everyone can see you discovered it|🔹 and more| lots| lots more… Building a base;  [May I add| with a very competent construction system] 🔸 That just looks good| 🔹 Provides shelter in harsh environments|🔸 Allows for item/resource/trophy storage|🔹 Can mine resources for either use or straight up profit|🔸 Can grow plans| fungus| ‘NipNip’ for use or profit|🔹 Can [non lethal] harvest from the local wildlife| for use or profit|🔸 Provide a garage for 4x different land Exocraft and 1x Underwater Exocraft|🔹 Creating a disco? With the newly added ByteBeat Device| Expanding your space presence; 🔹 Upgrading your personal ship with better engines| weapons| sensors|🔸 Buying a better personal ships [Haulers| Shuttles| Fighters and Explorers]🔹 Buying a Freighter [cheaper if you rescue it form pirates first] ;🔸 This can acts as a mobile base [doing almost all a planet base can| no exsocraft]| 🔹 Freighters act as a personal starship garage|🔸 A command post for your supporting fleet|🔹 Supporting ships can be sent on mission for your profit and there experience|🔸 Your combat support ships will aid you in space battles [if in same system]|Variables that affect everything to nothing; 🔸 Each star system is procedurally generated [4 star types] that affect Biodomes🔹 Each planet/moon is procedurally generated [~8 main types]🔸 Each planet/moon can have multiple of other factors;Rarity x4 with x10 variations for each| Biodome types x11| Levels of life| Weather levels| Density levels for: Flora| Forna| Minerals| Buildings| Archaeological sites| Locals| Sentinel presence| Crashed Starships and Freighters ...Valuables such as: Relic| Burial Sites| Salvage Containers| Gravitino balls ...[You can see how quickly this creates variation| and I just scratched the surface]🔹 Each system has its own economy. Better economy better prices|🔸 Each system has its own specialization; Manufacturing| Minning. Better related goods|🔹 Each system has its own conflict level| higher levels| more pirates and space battles|🔸 Economies can be influenced by high volume buying or selling|🔹 Multitools found at space stations or AI bases are procedurally generated|🔸 Starships found within a system have their own styles|🔹 Support Ships have unique stats| crew and potential issues/bonuses|🔸 Alien factions have relation levels to you| 🔹 This list would be pages long to do NMS justice 🔸 On the surface No Man’s Sky seems simple enough| but if you scratch the surface you find a galaxy sized rabbit hole that leads to endless explorations| and betterment.It should also be noted that the development team is still adding great content to the game that I assumed would have been kept for a sequel.They have far surpassed what this game was originally meant to be and with gradual betterment to all elements of the game and new additions [some never expected] | No Man's Sky is worth a look| or at least worth keeping an eye on as it grows beyond expectation.

Recommended,Posted: December 29| 2017,I played at launch| yelled at the screen and left it alone for a year.I came back with Atlas patch and in fairness the game was massively improved and actually playable.  I explored a fair bit| built a nice profitable base| upgraded stuff| etc etc.The problem I find is that the universe while vast| is just shallow.  I mean| at a certain point you just realize you are alone with nothing to do.  There is no feeling of intelligence life in the universe for you to interact with beyond a dozen different kind of scenarios so there is no real drive to explore because you know it will be the same exact situation.  Sure| you may find a new kind of world but its just eye candy with no hold on you beyond that.The game does what it tries to do well at this point but it's not a Star Trek - explore and meet new interesting people and places kind of experience and that is what I was hoping for (fair or not).If the game had a "maybe" then I would grade it at that| but for me its a thumbs down because I crave games that offer depth beyond eye candy.UPDATE:With the launch of beyond| I think there are enough improvements in the game play to really make it worthwhile.  The base building is interesting| Nexus adds some nice options and overall polish makes the game fun.I will say though| the game is what it is.  Meaning| I see NMS as an issue of quantity over quality.  The quality has increased enough to make things worthwhile but as a base building and exploration sim I still think something like Subnautica does a better job.  I would play both but if your waiting for NMS to grow into a super sized version of Subnautica I don't think that is realistic.

Not Recommended,Posted: August 31| 2016,I played this for many hours thinking that I would eventually get to actual gameplay behind the endless grind of upgrading the slots in your inventory.  The farther in I went| the more it became apparent that there WAS no game here.  What the developers have created is an excellent platform to build a game in.  They just never got that far.
Not Recommended,Posted: May 17| 2017,The fact that this title is still $60 says a lot about the ethics of Hello Games. The blatant lies told by the devs and the use of pre-rendered footage passed of as "actual gameplay" prior to release. The continuation of lies after the game was released. Yeah| they're adding new content (small amounts of it)| but too little too late. It was a cleverly disguised sham of a game that took you around 4 hours to dig below the thin surface to find out what you thought you bought was nowhere near what you received| allowing both Hello Games and Steam to skirt the refund policy. Quite possibly one of the worst game puchases I've ever made in 30 years of gaming.

Recommended,Posted: August 12| 2017,While I kinda "enjoyed" the game at release| I was quickly dissapointed by the expectations that they forced upon me. I eventually gave up after about 100 hours because it just wasnt what I wanted.Advance time by one year and here we are. With their latest huge update| they showed me that they do care about the state of the game and they brought it much closer to what I once believed this game would be judging by the videos and screenshots of E3.I had to mod this game to actually enjoy it previously| now?Most of the mods I used are implemented into the game and I don't even think I really want to mod the game anymore other than maybe reshade.You can now:-call your ship to you-teleport to your freighter-farming-building-terraforming(you were able to destroy| but now you can create)-vehicles-more quests and factions-more variety-muchhhhhh better graphics-30hr story expansion-Multiplayer(sorta like a beta but it works!)Honestly I can go on| but I really just wanna go play..!! With the special its on| if you were ever hesitant about this purchase| do it. You'll immerse yourself into a grand sandbox universe. HG really pulled it off. Late| but they did it. Give them a chance| I don't think you'll be dissapointed| not as much as release anyways.Keep it up team| you have my vote.
Not Recommended,Posted: January 23| 2017,Love it or hate it| this game is unfinished. The devs know it. Sony knows it. Everyone who bought this game knows it. It's able to sell because the game at heart has a great idea| and the devs and publisher know how to market it. The question is if you would pay $60 for an idea or a game. If you buy No Man's Sky| all you'll get is the former. If you're looking for the game| you won't find it here. They will tell you that you're buying the game (just look at these trailers and screenshots) but it's not. It's deceptive| disgusting| and borderline fraud| but it's business. Only purchase if you have faith in Hello Games| even after they lied to you.
Not Recommended,Posted: February 18| 2017,Learned a good lesson with buying this game: Don't board the hype train.  I really wanted to like this game after I bought it (The $150 Explorers Edition).  The game is boring and you are stuck doing the same crap from planet to planet.  It would have been a good game at $10 because it feels like a unfinished beta.  It has so many missing features.  This is not the game that they showed in the trailers.
Not Recommended,Posted: September 10| 2019,I respect the hell out of what Hello Games has done to improve the state of this game. I played it at launch| and I played it again any time a major expansion released and each time it has gotten better and better. In its current state| there is much more to do| there are places to explore and a storyline to follow| and a "point" to gathering all of the materials: base building| upgrades| and more. For that| it is commendable - and I certainly appreciate a new space VR game to take some time out of Elite. But this is still not a game that I can recommend. Hello Games has addressed the problem of there being nothing to do in the game but have failed to fix basic issues that keep turning me away from the game each time that I come back to it. These include:   Terrain pop-in. A game as massive as this will need to manage draw distance in some way| I understand that. What I cannot forgive is mountains and trees that change shape drastically several times as I fly toward them| or even worse appear out of thin air giving me no time to crash into them. Which leads me directly into:   The wishy-washy flight model. Ships fishtail around in the sky and don't differ meaningfully from each other in terms of handling| acceleration and features. Ships auto-accelerate and never fully stop| making it difficult to perform precise maneuvers. The game also babies you and tries its best to not let you crash into terrain. You have to be so precise with your aim in space combat that it is almost impossible to line up shots in a consistent manner. It just doesn't feel good to be in my spaceship in this game| whether in first or third-person view and in a game that is ostensibly about exploring the universe| this is unforgivable. To be clear: I don't want Elite: Dangerous or Star Citizen levels of realism in the flight model but I want to do ill-advised stunts through archways in the terrain| and juke enemies in an asteroid field and I want to do it all in a ship that feels responsive and accurate.   The Color Palette and planet generation. Very| very few planets that I have come across thus far have been interesting. Sure| there are neat plants and things to explore but 9/10 planets feel drab| lifeless| and marred by drastic color contrasts or uninteresting palettes. In the game I recently started| I went to a Red Planet| a Pink Planet| a Beige Planet| a Green Planet| another Red Planet| and finally another Beige Planet. None of them offered landscapes that were particularly interesting. Nothing I wanted to build a base on let alone explore for more than a few minutes to find the resources I need| and then get back off. Combined with the pop-in issues and generally unimpressive effects| textures and lighting I don't ever want to remain planetside for longer than I have to.   Performance Issues. My rig is running a Ryzen 3900X and a 2080 Ti with 16 GB of RAM. There should not be performance issues and yet when interacting with Knowledge Stones| entering atmospheres and at random points throughout the game I experience stutter| missed inputs and general frame drops. This isn't in VR| it's not in 4K| and my system usage isn't maxing out when this happens either.    Inventory Management. My God almighty this is unimpressive. The layout of your... what is it... six? seven maybe? separate inventories/technology layouts is unintelligible| clunky and difficult to manage on a controller. Simple as that| it's bad. There have been updates addressing the most common QoL complaints but it needs a revamp from the bottom up to keep up with all the upgrades| separate materials and crafting components. It's way too small and way too hard to manage. I will keep coming back to No Man's Sky every time there is an update. I really want this game to be great. I share Hello Games' vision of a "Chill exploration experience|" letting off steam laid back with my controller or with my headset captaining a ship through an exotic| surreal galaxy. But it cannot be chill if I'm constantly managing my inventory. I don't want to explore when every planet is uninteresting and graphical glitches abound. And it's not a good experience when I don't enjoy flying in my spaceship or dealing with performance issues. This game is worth keeping up with| and not worth giving up on. I don't think I ever will. I am impressed by how far it has come and am just waiting for that last extra step before I will enjoy it.
Recommended,Posted: August 12| 2017,For a game that got crapped on by everybody and has become a joke. Hello Games is still working to improve the game and listen to its customers even now| instead of taking the money and running. To me thats worth a lot in the gaming community.
